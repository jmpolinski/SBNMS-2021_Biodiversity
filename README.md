# Ecosystem-wide biodiversity with environmental DNA to inform management of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary

The purpose of this study was to test the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) to assess whole ecosystem biodivesity using a suite of metabarcoding targets - 16S for prokaryotes, 18S for eukaryotes, and 12S for vertebrates.  
  
Surface water, bottom water, and sediment were collected from 41 survey sites spanning the Stellwagen Bank underwater plateau in July 2021.
